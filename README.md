# Vision (DRAFT)
I’m working with a community of researchers, hobbyists and industry partners to build the most powerful, portable automated liquid handling platform to address humanity's most pressing challenges in health, food and the environment.

I’m working open because I believe that these tools are fundamental to our future and that they are too valuable to be under the control of a single entity. I also believe that collaboration and sharing of resources is the most effective way to make this vision a reality.
